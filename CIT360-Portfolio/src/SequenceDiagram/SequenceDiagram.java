 * 5/7/2016
 * Sequence diagrams are a method of documenting and visualizing the handling of messages
 * and calling processes within an event sequence.  Below is a link I used for reading 
 * more about sequence diagrams.
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram
 * I've attached a set of sequence diagrams I created for CIT-262 last semester which 
 * helped me refresh my memory regarding this subject.  The file is Group 4 - Lab 5.pdf
