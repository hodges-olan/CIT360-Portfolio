/*
 * MVC (Model, View, Control)
 * Brandon Urednick presented over MVC this week and explained the purpose behind MVC.
 * He used the link at http://www.w3schools.com/aspnet/mvc_intro.asp to show us the
 * meaning behind each of the layers.  I can see how this is a popular method, as it
 * allows you to break down the basic functionality of most programs to this separate
 * sections.  This was the same way we split up the game that we created in CIT-260,
 * so it was somewhat familiar to most of us.
